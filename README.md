Simple swap to another scene in Streamlabs OBS for a given period and then back using a given command in Streamlabs Chatbot

# Credit

I take no credit for the real work to build this. It's two seperate scripts stuck together

Credit to Ocgineer who developed the bridge app for talking to SLOBS. 
Credit to Bare7a as his SimpleTTS acted as the Base of this in terms of cool down and cost logic.

Installing, download this Repo and drop into the scripts folder.

Alternatively put into a ZIP and then import it.
